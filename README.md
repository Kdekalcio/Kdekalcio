Hello there, first off I'd like to thank you for ending up here and reading this!
- Nationality: Chilean. Native language is Ñ. As you can see, I know English. I've also been learning a bit of Japanese, though I still can't really understand stuff, just read the
  hiragana and katakana.  
- I sometimes play videogames and read manga my friends recommend to me. I sometimes draw on paper or make pixel-art.
- Star Wars Legends nerd and a big Revan fangirl (as in screeching over him), I do not have a good way to express how I felt when they announced KOTOR Remake.
- EarthBound/MOTHER fan.
- I like TMNT, they're my childhood: I watched the 90s' movies when I was younger (I admit it: we used to consume pirated content when I was younger) and, even though I've lost some
  interest as I grew up, they still bring me back from time to time. In the last year I've played TMNT Shredder's Revenge and read some of the original TMNT comic book from the '80s.
- Casual Pokémon Adventures/Pocket Monsters Special reader. If you're wondering: no, it ain't as edgy as people on the internet claim it is, those out-of-context panels roaming
  around are just early installment weirdness at most, but what it does have is lovable and memorable characters.
- Hmm... Should I have a place where I can show my pixel-art and drawings I talked about?
- I have more to tell here but I don't want to consume all your time, maybe ask me through messaging, if GitHub has some kind of messaging feature...
- When I was younger I used to do silly kid stuff on Roblox and tried to make a Minecraft texture pack, years passed and when I was older I got a bit into ROM-hacking. There was a
  time when I got into Scratch, too (before I got into ROM-hacking). I’m currently learning Python, been enjoying it.
- I'll probably be using this account for some of my projects and MAYBE I will someday open a public repository for an "official" public project.
- How to reach me: I, uhh... don't really use social media... I am not sure of where would you be able to reach me... It would be nice if we just talked about stuff we just enjoy
  doing and each other, if we could...
